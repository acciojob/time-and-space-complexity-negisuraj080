	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the efficiency of an algorithm concerning the amount of time it takes to complete its execution. An algorithm is considered efficient if it can solve a problem in a reasonable amount of time, even as the size of the input increases.
    </p>

    <p>
        Space Complexity is a measure of the amount of memory space an algorithm uses based on the size of the input. In Big O notation, it is commonly represented as O(n), where 'n' is the size of the input. <b>Space Complexity</b> helps us analyze how much memory an algorithm requires as its input grows.
